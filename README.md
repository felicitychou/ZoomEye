# ZoomEye SDK For Python Support python2 and python3 

###ZoomEye_use_requests.py###
This SDK has only one file.But You need to install Python Package requests before using ZoomEye_use_requests.py.

Install Command</br>
pip install requests</br>
https://pypi.python.org/pypi/requests/2.9.1</br>

###ZoomEye.py###
If you don’t want to install Python Package requests,you can use ZoomEye.py.</br>
But you need req.py in my project.


##I provide a demo.py for you to learn how to use this SDK.##
##If you have any questions or suggestions, You can submit a new issue.##
