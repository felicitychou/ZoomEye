# ZoomEye SDK For Python 
**Support python2 and python3**</br>
API Doc: https://www.zoomeye.org/api/doc

###ZoomEye_use_requests.py 
This SDK has only one file.
But You need to install Python Package requests before using ZoomEye_use_requests.py.

Install Command: ```pip install requests```
https://pypi.python.org/pypi/requests/2.9.1</br>

###ZoomEye.py
If you donâ€™t want to install Python Package requests,you can use ZoomEye.py.</br>
But you need req.py in my project.

### How to use?
I provide a demo.py for you to learn how to use this SDK.

### Problems
If you have any questions or suggestions, You can submit a new issue.
